Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the dd position at jd. I am confident that my strong academic background in Business Administration with a Marketing Emphasis, as well as my excellent communication skills, make me a great fit for this role.

As a current student at Bellevue University, I am expected to graduate in June, 20xx with a GPA of 3.56/4.00. Throughout my coursework, I have gained valuable knowledge in marketing principles, business communication, internet marketing, consumer behavior, public relations, and business policy & strategy. These courses have equipped me with the necessary skills to excel in a marketing or public relations role.

In terms of work experience, I have been working as an Academic Tutor at Bellevue University since 20xx. In this role, I have assisted college students in overcoming academic challenges and successfully mastering their coursework. This experience has allowed me to develop strong interpersonal and problem-solving skills.

Additionally, I have worked as a Senior Accounts Receivable Clerk at Lincoln Financial Group from 20xx to 20xx. In this position, I researched story ideas, wrote articles, and participated in the publication of a weekly in-house newsletter. I also assisted customers and staff members in resolving problems and balancing accounts, managed daily accounts receivable deposits, and conducted extensive research to recover lost checks. These experiences have honed my attention to detail, organizational skills, and ability to work effectively in a team.

Furthermore, I have served as an Advertising Coordinator for The Vue, Bellevue University's student newspaper, since 20xx. This role has allowed me to develop my creativity and marketing skills by coordinating advertising efforts and promoting the newspaper to the student body.

In addition to my academic and work experiences, I am bilingual in English and Spanish, which allows me to effectively communicate with a diverse range of individuals. I am also proficient in MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and Photoshop, which are valuable skills in today's digital marketing landscape.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to jd's corporate social responsibility efforts in the dd role. I believe that my academic background, work experience, and language and computer skills make me a strong candidate for this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the requirements of the dd position at jd.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
