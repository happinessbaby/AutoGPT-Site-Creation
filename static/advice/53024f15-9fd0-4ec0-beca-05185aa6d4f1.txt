The resume contains the following fields:
- Personal information (name, address, contact information)
- Summary of qualifications
- Education

- Work history
- Professional affiliation
- Computer skills

#### The resume contains all the necessary fields for a resume.

Step 2: Determine if information contained in the fields such as objective, work experience and skills is relevant to accountant and accountant's job description.

Based on the job description provided, the following information is irrelevant to an accountant's resume:
- Objective: The resume does not include an objective, which is not necessary for an accountant's resume.
- Professional accomplishments: The resume includes professional accomplishments related to accounting and financial management, which are relevant to an accountant's job description.
- Work history: The resume includes work history related to accounting and bookkeeping positions, which are relevant to an accountant's job description.
- Professional affiliation: The resume includes professional affiliation with the IMA, which is relevant to an accountant's job description.
- Computer skills: The resume includes computer skills relevant to an accountant's job description.

#### All the information contained in the fields is relevant to an accountant's job description.

Step 3: Research sample resume provided.

The sample resume provided is not delimited with //// characters. Therefore, it cannot be compared with the resume in Step 1 to identify missing contents.

#### No additional information can be extracted from the sample resume.

Step 3: An resume advisor has also given some advices on what makes a bad resume and how to write good resume.

Based on the advice given, the following suggestions can be made for the resume:

- Objective: Although an objective is not necessary for an accountant's resume, it can be beneficial to include a brief summary or profile statement at the beginning of the resume to highlight key qualifications and career goals.
- Work experience: The resume should include more detailed information about the responsibilities and achievements in each work experience, using bullet points to make it easier to read and highlight relevant skills and accomplishments.
- Education: The resume should include the expected graduation date and the GPA to date, as well as any relevant coursework or projects.
- Professional accomplishments: The resume should include specific examples of accomplishments and achievements in the accounting and financial management field, such as cost savings, process improvements, or successful audits.
- Skills: The resume should include a separate section for skills, highlighting both hard skills (such as proficiency in accounting software) and soft skills (such as analytical and problem-solving skills).

#### The resume can be improved by including a summary or profile statement, providing more detailed information about work experience, including expected graduation date and GPA, highlighting specific accomplishments, and including a separate skills section.
